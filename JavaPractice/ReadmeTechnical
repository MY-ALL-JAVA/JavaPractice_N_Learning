#1  Java Fundamentals ::
-------------------------
Java Is A True Object Oriented Programming Language. 

Below is a list of java primative data type :
int(4 bytes), float(4 bytes), double(8 bytes), char(1byte), long(8 byte), bit(1 byte), byte(8 byte)

important features of java :: Distributed, High Interpreted, Oop, MultiThreaded, Architectural Neutral

OOP Principles :
OOP Allows us to decompose a problem into a number of entities called Object, and then Built Data N Function together around it.
Object : Is an Instance of Class.
    Data Abstraction & Encapsulation
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance
    ...


DataTypes In Java ::
    Primitive
        |   --  Boolean
        |   --  Numeric
        |           |   --  Character
        |           |   --  Integeral
        |                        |   --  Integer (byte, short, int, long)
        |                        |   --  Floating Point (Float, Double)
    NonPrimitive
        |   --  String, Array, etc..


Calling / Invoking ::
    Calling a method refers to - calling it explicitely in a program.
    Invoking a method refers to - Method is get called by JVM, Sometimes is also refered to as Callback.

Description On Simple Java Program :
> The Class Name Should be same name as File Name.
> Class Name Must Starts with a Capital Letter.
> The Code Snippet :: public static void main(String args[]){} is described as follow.
    It is required acess specifier as - public - as needs to acess by the JVM Class, Which is out side the current class.
    The - static - is required as the main() method, needs to be acess without creating an object of the class contains it.
    return type void - referes to the method doesn't return anything
    argument to the main method args[] is of String type, which holds the argument passed to the main program while running the program from the command line.
    However the 0th elemet is the Program name(i.e. class name) itself.
